### Problem
With the confirmed numbers increasing in the states, it has been difficult for travel agencies to decide which areas they should host their events.
With this app, we would like to answer the following questions for our users:

- What are the top locations in the US that we should consider hosting our event?
- What areas should we avoid housing any events?
- Which region (northern/southern/eastern/western) overall have the highest covid trend?
<br/>

### Solution
To answer the previous questions, we will use the COVID-19 data (src: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset) to perform analysis queries and get a better understanding of the risks and benefits of travel in each region.


### Tech Stack:
